# OS_HW
Welcome to the OS_HW Repository! This space is dedicated to sharing assignments from the Operating Systems course I undertook, led by Professor Rachel Kolodny, current Head of the Computer Science Department at the University of Haifa. Each piece of work here, with the exception of Homework 3 (a collaborative effort with friends), is my original contribution. Initially, these assignments were part of a private submission last year, but due to high demand, I've decided to make them public. Whether you’re a student or just someone keen to explore operating systems, feel free to delve into my solutions! For queries, clarifications, or discussions, please use the repository’s Issues section.
